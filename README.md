# VSOS ON NSSCPU
VSOS on Not So Simple CPU

Aim of this project is to replicate the early modern operating systems on the locally developed Very Simple CPU® (H. Fatih Uğurdağ)

We make the following assumptions:
  ● Applications gracefully exit after execution.
  ● Applications load in first-in-first-out methods.
